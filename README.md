## Project Description
Bartit is a web platform that aims to promote the exchange of goods and services between individuals in a community. Inspired by the "barter system", Bartit facilitates a platform for people to trade goods and services without the need for traditional currency.

The platform is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django, and MongoDB. Users can sign up and create a profile on the platform. Once signed in, users can view listings of available goods and services, create listings for their own goods and services, and contact other users to initiate a trade.

The platform features a search function that allows users to search for specific items or services. Additionally, the platform features a messaging system that allows users to communicate and finalize details of the trade. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for each other based on their trading experiences.

Bartit is designed to promote community engagement, reduce waste, and encourage sustainable practices. The platform encourages users to trade goods and services rather than purchasing new items, which reduces waste and promotes sustainable consumption.

Overall, Bartit is a unique platform that promotes community engagement, sustainability, and ethical consumption practices. It provides a convenient and user-friendly platform for individuals to connect and trade goods and services in their local communities.
